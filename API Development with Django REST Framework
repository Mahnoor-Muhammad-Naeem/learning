# Django REST Framework with ML:
what is an api?
API stands for Application Programming Interface.
It acts as a two-way communication bridge between frontend and backend.

# what is REST API?
REST stands for Representational State Transfer.
It organizes how web applications talk to each other, separating what the user sees (frontend) from what runs behind the scenes (backend).

# core principles of REST:
stateless:
the server doesn't store any information about the client between requests.

client-server architecture:
the app (client) asks for things (data) and the server does what's requested (sends data or makes changes).

standardized interface:
REST APIs rely on a set of standard methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) for interacting with resources.

GET - retrieving the resource
POST - creating the resource
PUT - updating the resource
DELETE - deleting the resource

easy-to-read data:
REST APIs returns the response in a standardized to read formats, typically JSON or XML formats.

RESTful Operations:
GET, POST, PUT, DELETE

                 URI
GET              /students
POST             /students
PUT              /student/1
DELETE           /student/1
